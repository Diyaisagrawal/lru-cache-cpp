# lru-cache-cpp

A production-style implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache in C++
using object-oriented design principles. The cache uses a hash map and a
doubly linked list to support O(1) get and put operations and is designed
for Linux environments.

## Features
- O(1) time complexity for get and put
- Clean, modular OOP design
- Designed for extensibility and maintainability

## Tech Stack
- C++
- STL (unordered_map)
- Linux

## Status
Project setup completed. Core cache logic under development.
